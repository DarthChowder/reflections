When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To allow easy collaboration with others. It is also a great way to have a backup of your files, in case you have a local data loss scenario.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you could be working on the same file as someone else and their changes might overwrite work you have done.
