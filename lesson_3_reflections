When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To allow easy collaboration with others. It is also a great way to have a backup of your files, in case you have a local data loss scenario.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you could be working on the same file as someone else and their changes might overwrite work you have done.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are when you are creating a copy of someone else's repository, you use this when you want to work on the code without submitting any commits to a master branch owned by someone else. Clones are how you copy a repository onto your local machine to edit files in a local instance. Branches are how you create a new channel for commits that will not effect another branch, you would use this when you are working in a team and want to test a feature outside of the master branch.
