What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file that is tracking any changes that occur in the directory you initialize. If you do not initialize the respository, not changes will be tracked, and you cannot use the git functions for your chosen directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place that allows you to "Queue" up some files before sending them to the repository. The value there is that you can also remove things from the staging area before finalizing a commit.
