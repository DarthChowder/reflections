What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file that is tracking any changes that occur in the directory you initialize. If you do not initialize the respository, not changes will be tracked, and you cannot use the git functions for your chosen directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place that allows you to "Queue" up some files before sending them to the repository. The value there is that you can also remove things from the staging area before finalizing a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You chave many options for viewing what changes you have made and what is being staged, so you only are committing things that you meant to commit. You can also resest other changes you didn't intend.
